Small project developed by Vinayak Ghodke for Equip-9
I have developed this project using MERN stack.
In this project user can register in front end then all data goes to backend via axios & then to database through express server.
password stored in database as a hashed password using B-crypt.
I have also created REST api using express server.
Stored procedure in my-sql is there in utilities folder and I have also created UML use case diagram using draw.io & you can find the same in utilities folder.
I hope you will like it.
Thank you so much Equip-9 team for such a wondeful opportunity to test my all skills in MERN stack development.
I got learn so many things in this project but I have some regret regarding project that I'm not able to complete it fully but it took the best out of me to do as much I have done.

Thank you so much.
Hoping for a positive response.
Regards,
Vinayak Ghodke.
